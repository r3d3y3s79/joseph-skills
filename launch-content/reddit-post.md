I created 50+ Claude Code skills for content creators — sharing the collection

## Body

Hey everyone,

I've been using Claude Code for content creation and got tired of re-explaining what I wanted every session. So I built a library of reusable skills.

**What's in it:**
- 12 content creation skills (YouTube scripts, blogs, newsletters)
- 10 e-commerce skills (Shopify, Amazon, Etsy listings)
- 8 business skills (proposals, cold emails, SOPs)
- 7 developer skills (API docs, READMEs, changelogs)
- 10 marketing skills (ad copy, landing pages, CTAs)

**Each skill includes:**
- Structured output template
- 3 complete examples
- Quality checklist
- Common mistakes to avoid

**Free preview:** [github.com/r3d3y3s79/joseph-skills](https://github.com/r3d3y3s79/joseph-skills)

You can browse all the skills, see exactly what they do, and copy any you want.

If you want the complete system packaged up with premium workflow skills, I put together Content Empire Pro: [storemanjoe3.gumroad.com/l/iicrm](https://storemanjoe3.gumroad.com/l/iicrm)

Use code **LAUNCH50** for 50% off if you want to support the project.

Happy to answer questions about how the skills work or how to customize them for your use case.
