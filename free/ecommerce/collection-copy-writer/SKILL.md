## Copy Frameworks

### The Curator
Position yourself as expert selector:
- "We've tested dozens to bring you the best..."
- "Hand-selected for [specific criteria]..."
- "Our buyers chose these for..."

### The Problem Solver
Focus on customer needs:
- "Looking for [solution]? You'll find it here."
- "Whether you need X or Y, this collection has..."
- "Everything you need for [goal] in one place."

### The Lifestyle
Paint a picture:
- "Imagine [desirable scenario]..."
- "For those who [aspirational identity]..."
- "The collection for [lifestyle]..."

## Common Mistakes

- **No hero copy**: Don't rely on products alone to sell
- **Keyword stuffing**: Natural language beats repetition
- **Too much text above products**: Hero copy should be brief
- **Missing internal links**: Connect to related collections
- **Generic descriptions**: Make each collection unique
- **Ignoring mobile**: 60%+ shop on phones—be concise
