## Seasonal Tone Guidelines

### Black Friday/Cyber Monday
- All about the deal
- Maximum urgency
- Numbers front and center
- "Best prices of the year"

### Christmas/Holiday Season
- Warm and giving
- Gift-focused messaging
- Shipping deadlines matter
- "Perfect gift" language

### Valentine's Day
- Romantic and thoughtful
- Partner-focused or self-love angle
- "Show them you care"
- Red/pink themes

### Mother's/Father's Day
- Appreciation and celebration
- Gift guide approach
- "They deserve it"
- Personal touch emphasis

### Summer/Spring
- Light and energetic
- Outdoor and activity themes
- Fresh, bright imagery
- Season transition

### Back to School
- Preparation and readiness
- Practical value
- Checklist approach
- "Start fresh" messaging

## Common Mistakes

- **Wrong tone**: Black Friday energy on Mother's Day feels off
- **Unclear deadlines**: "Limited time" means nothing—give dates
- **Generic copy**: "Holiday Sale" without personality
- **Missing shipping info**: Holiday shoppers need arrival guarantees
- **Weak urgency**: "Shop now" without reason
- **Forgetting mobile**: Most seasonal traffic is mobile
