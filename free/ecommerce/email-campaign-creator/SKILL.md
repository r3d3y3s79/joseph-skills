## Quick Reference

| Element | Best Practice |
|---------|--------------|
| Subject line | 6-10 words, under 50 characters |
| Preview text | 35-90 characters, complement subject |
| Email length | 100-200 words for promos |
| CTA buttons | 2-4 words, action-oriented |
| Images | Hero image + 1-2 product images |
| Links | 2-3 max per email |
| Send time | Tue-Thu, 10am or 2pm |

## Campaign Types

### Promotional/Sale
- Create urgency with deadlines
- Show discount clearly
- Feature best products
- One clear CTA

### Cart Abandonment
- Send within 1 hour (first email)
- Show exact items left behind
- Address objections
- Offer help, not just discount

### Welcome Sequence
- Email 1: Thank you + brand story
- Email 2: Best sellers or getting started
- Email 3: Social proof + first purchase incentive

### Product Launch
- Build anticipation before
- Clear value proposition on launch day
- Follow up with social proof

### Win-back
- Acknowledge the gap
- Remind them of value
- Incentivize return
- Make it easy

## Common Mistakes

- **No preview text**: Wasted opportunity
- **Too many CTAs**: One primary action per email
- **Weak subject lines**: Test multiple variants
- **Wall of text**: Break up with headers and bullets
- **Missing urgency**: Give reasons to act now
- **Forgetting mobile**: 60%+ open on phones
