## Quick Reference

| Element | Best Practice |
|---------|--------------|
| Title | 150-200 characters, front-load keywords |
| Bullet points | Start with CAPS benefit, 150-200 chars each |
| Description | 1500-2000 characters, scannable |
| Backend keywords | No commas, no duplicates, 250 bytes |
| Images mentioned | Reference lifestyle + detail shots |
| Brand name | Include once in title, once in bullets |

## Amazon Title Formulas

### Standard Product
`[Brand] [Product Type] [Key Feature] [Material/Size] [Quantity] - [Benefit Keyword]`

### Variation Product
`[Brand] [Product Type] for [Use Case] - [Size/Color] - [Key Benefit]`

### Bundle Product
`[Brand] [Main Product] with [Accessory] - [Quantity] [Unit] - [Benefit]`

## Bullet Point Framework

### The BENEFIT-FEATURE-PROOF Pattern
1. **CAPS BENEFIT HEADLINE**: Lead with what customer gets
2. Feature explanation: How the product delivers this benefit
3. Proof element: Material, certification, or comparison

### Keywords Integration
- Front-load primary keyword in first bullet
- Distribute secondary keywords across all bullets
- Use natural language (no keyword stuffing)

## Common Mistakes

- **Keyword stuffing**: Amazon penalizes unreadable listings
- **All caps everything**: Only capitalize benefit headlines
- **Repeating keywords**: Backend search terms should be unique
- **Ignoring mobile**: 70%+ shop on mobile—keep bullets scannable
- **Weak first bullet**: Most important—address main pain point
- **Missing specifications**: Include dimensions, materials, compatibility
