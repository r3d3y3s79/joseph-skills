4. Offer concrete resolution
5. Move conversation offline with contact info

## Tone Guidelines

### DO
- Be genuine and specific
- Take ownership of problems
- Offer real solutions
- Stay professional when provoked
- Reference actual review content

### DON'T
- Use copy-paste generic responses
- Get defensive or argumentative
- Make excuses
- Ignore valid criticism
- Over-promise resolutions you can't deliver

## Common Mistakes

- **Generic responses**: "Thanks for your feedback" shows no effort
- **Arguing with reviewers**: You never win public arguments
- **Ignoring negative reviews**: Silence looks like not caring
- **Over-responding**: Keep it concise—long defenses look defensive
- **Missing contact info**: Negative reviews need an exit path
- **Different responses, same issues**: Fix the underlying problem

## Examples

### Example 1: Positive Review Response

**Input**: Respond to a 5-star Amazon review: "Absolutely love this coffee maker! Makes perfect coffee every morning. The timer feature is a game changer - I wake up to fresh coffee. Only had it for a month but already can't imagine mornings without it. Highly recommend to anyone who takes their coffee seriously."

**Output**:
```

REVIEW RATING: 5 stars

RESPONSE:

Hi there,

Thank you so much for this wonderful review! We're thrilled the timer feature has transformed your mornings—waking up to fresh-brewed coffee is one of our favorite things about this model too.

It's great to hear it's already become an essential part of your routine after just a month. That's exactly the kind of reliability we design for.

If you ever have questions or want brewing tips to get even more out of your machine, we're always here to help.

Happy brewing!

### Example 2: Negative Review Response

**Input**: Respond to a 1-star Yelp review for a restaurant: "Waited 45 minutes for our food after ordering. When it finally arrived, my steak was overcooked and cold. Server was nice but clearly overwhelmed. For these prices, this is unacceptable. We asked for a manager but were told none was available. Very disappointed - we were celebrating a birthday and this ruined the evening."

**Output**:
```
REVIEW TYPE: Negative
PLATFORM: Yelp
REVIEW RATING: 1 star

RESPONSE:

Hi [Reviewer Name],

I'm truly sorry your birthday celebration didn't go as planned. A 45-minute wait, overcooked steak, and no manager available—that's not the experience we want for anyone, especially on a special occasion.

There's no excuse for what happened. You're right to be disappointed.

I'd like to make this right. Please reach out to me directly at [email] or call [phone number] and ask for [Name], General Manager. I want to hear more about what happened and personally ensure your next visit reflects the experience we're capable of providing.

Thank you for taking the time to share this feedback—it helps us get better.

General Manager, [Restaurant Name]

### Example 3: Mixed/Neutral Review Response

**Input**: Respond to a 3-star Google review for an online clothing store: "The sweater I ordered is really soft and the color is beautiful. Fits true to size. But shipping took 2 weeks which seems long, and the packaging was just a plastic bag - not great for a $75 sweater. Product itself is nice though."

**Output**:
```
REVIEW TYPE: Mixed/Neutral
PLATFORM: Google
REVIEW RATING: 3 stars

RESPONSE:

Hi [Reviewer Name],

Thank you for the honest feedback—we really appreciate it.

We're glad the sweater met your expectations for softness, color, and fit. Those details matter, and it's great to hear we got them right.

You're absolutely right about the shipping time and packaging. Two weeks is longer than it should be, and a $75 sweater deserves better than a plastic mailer. We've been working on both issues—upgraded packaging is rolling out this month, and we're adding fulfillment capacity to speed up delivery times.

We'd love the chance to show you the improved experience. Your next order ships free—just use code THANKYOU at checkout.

Thanks again for helping us improve.

Best,
[Name]
Customer Experience Team
