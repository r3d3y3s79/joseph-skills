## Quick Reference

| Element | Best Practice |
|---------|--------------|
| Title | 140 characters, front-load keywords |
| Description | 300-500 words, tell a story |
| Tags | All 13 slots, multi-word phrases |
| First image | Show product clearly, good lighting |
| Processing time | Be honest, add buffer |
| Personalization | Mention if available |

## Etsy SEO Essentials

### Title Structure
Front-load your most important keywords—Etsy weighs early words more heavily.

**Good**: "Personalized Leather Journal Custom Engraved Notebook Gift for Him"
**Bad**: "Great Gift Idea - Journal Made of Leather with Custom Engraving"

### Tag Strategy
- Use all 13 tags
- Multi-word phrases work better than single words
- Match tag phrases to actual search terms
- Include gift-related tags when relevant

### Description Keywords
Repeat key phrases naturally in your description—Etsy reads descriptions for search relevance.

## Description Frameworks

### The Maker's Story
1. What inspired this creation
2. Materials and process
3. What makes it special
4. Who it's perfect for

### The Gift Guide
1. Who would love this gift
2. Why it's meaningful
3. What's included
4. Personalization options

### The Problem Solver
1. What problem it solves
2. How it works
3. Why this version is better
4. Results customers can expect

## Common Mistakes

- **Keyword stuffing in titles**: Reads unnaturally, hurts conversions
- **Forgetting mobile shoppers**: 65% of Etsy traffic is mobile
- **Vague dimensions**: Always include measurements
- **Missing care instructions**: Reduces post-purchase questions
- **No story element**: Handmade buyers want connection
- **Unused tag slots**: Fill all 13—free search visibility

## Examples

DESCRIPTION:

These delicate pearl hoop earrings catch the light with every movement. Simple enough for everyday wear, elegant enough for your wedding day.

ABOUT THESE EARRINGS

The pearls are hand-selected for their luster and individually wire-wrapped onto 20mm hoops. Because they're natural pearls, each pair has subtle variations that make them uniquely yours.

CARE INSTRUCTIONS
Store in the included pouch when not wearing. Remove before swimming, showering, or sleeping. Gently wipe with a soft cloth after wear to maintain luster.

### Example 3: Vintage Item

**Input**: Write an Etsy listing for a vintage 1970s brass table lamp with original glass shade, working condition

**Output**:
```
TITLE (136 characters):
Vintage Brass Table Lamp 1970s, Mid Century Modern Lamp with Glass Shade, Retro Desk Lamp, Working Vintage Lighting, MCM Home Decor

---

DESCRIPTION:

This 1970s brass table lamp still glows as warmly as the day it was made. Original glass shade intact, freshly rewired, ready to illuminate your space.

THE STORY

Found in an estate sale in Connecticut, this lamp sat on a professor's desk for decades before coming to my workshop. The patina tells its history—subtle darkening in the crevices, warm golden tones on the high points. I cleaned it gently to preserve that character rather than polish it away.

The glass shade is original and undamaged—increasingly rare for lamps of this era. The soft white glass diffuses light beautifully without glare.

CONDITION DETAILS
- Fully functional - rewired with new UL-listed cord and plug
- Original brass base with natural aged patina
- Original glass shade, no chips or cracks
- Standard E26 socket, works with regular bulbs up to 60W
- On/off switch tested and working smoothly

MEASUREMENTS
- Total height: 18 inches
- Shade diameter: 8 inches
- Base diameter: 6 inches
- Cord length: 6 feet (new)

WHAT'S INCLUDED
- Vintage brass lamp with glass shade
- LED bulb (2700K warm white, energy efficient)
- Brief care guide

ABOUT VINTAGE ITEMS
This is a true vintage piece from the 1970s. Minor surface wear is present and considered part of its character. All functional aspects have been updated for modern safety.

SHIPPING & HANDLING
- Processing: Ships within 2 business days
- Packaging: Double-boxed with custom foam protection
- Ships from: New Haven, Connecticut
- Insurance: Included for full value

This lamp pairs perfectly with mid-century modern decor but looks equally at home in eclectic or traditional spaces. Only one available—vintage finds don't repeat.

Questions about condition or shipping? Happy to send additional photos or information.
