## Bundle Types

### Starter Kit
Everything a beginner needs:
- Core product + essentials
- Removes guesswork
- Perfect for new customers

More quantity, better price:
- Same product, multiple units
- Clear per-unit savings
- Appeals to loyal customers

### Complete Set

## Copy Formulas

### Headlines
- "Everything You Need to [Outcome]"
- "The Complete [Category] Kit"
- "[Product] + [Product] = [Benefit]"
- "Get More, Spend Less"
- "Your [Result] Starter Pack"

### Savings Callouts
- "Save $XX when you bundle"
- "XX% off when bought together"
- "$XX value for just $XX"
- "Get [item] FREE (a $XX value)"

### Value Statements
- "Why buy separately when you can save together?"
- "These products work better together"
- "Everything you need in one click"

## Common Mistakes

- **Fuzzy math**: Show exact savings, not just "great value"
- **Random products**: Bundle items that logically connect
- **Missing "why"**: Explain why these products together
- **No urgency**: Give reasons to buy now vs. later
- **Weak naming**: "Bundle 1" tells customers nothing
- **Ignoring per-unit value**: Quantity bundles need per-unit math
