# YouTube Script Pro

Write YouTube scripts that keep viewers watching. This skill focuses on the structural elements that drive watch time: hooks that stop the scroll, retention triggers that prevent drop-off, and endings that convert viewers to subscribers.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Writing scripts for YouTube videos (5-30 minutes)
- Creating shorts or vertical video scripts (under 60 seconds)
- Outlining documentary-style content
- Structuring educational or tutorial videos
- Drafting commentary or opinion videos

## Output Structure

### Script Header
Every script starts with metadata:
- Working title (for SEO testing)
- Target length (minutes)
- Thumbnail concept (1 sentence)
- First-line hook (the actual opening words)

### Hook Section (0:00-0:30)
The first 30 seconds follow this structure:
1. Pattern interrupt (0:00-0:05) - Visual or audio that stops scrolling
2. Promise statement (0:05-0:15) - What viewer gets by watching
3. Credibility marker (0:15-0:25) - Why you can deliver on promise
4. Loop open (0:25-0:30) - Curiosity gap that demands resolution

### Body Sections
Each body section includes:
- Section header with timestamp
- Retention trigger (question, reveal, or transition)
- Core content (2-4 paragraphs)
- B-roll/visual suggestions in [brackets]
- Engagement marker (comment prompt or reaction moment)

### Closing Section
- Payoff delivery (resolve the loop opened in hook)
- Value recap (3 bullet takeaways)
- Subscribe CTA with specific reason
- Next video tease with specific topic

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing output, verify:
- [ ] Hook delivers pattern interrupt in first 5 seconds
- [ ] Promise is specific and measurable (not vague)
- [ ] At least one retention trigger per 90 seconds of content
- [ ] B-roll suggestions are actionable (not just "show relevant footage")
- [ ] Subscribe CTA gives specific reason (not "hit subscribe")
- [ ] No filler phrases ("without further ado", "let's dive in")
- [ ] Word count matches target length (150 words per minute)
- [ ] Each section has engagement prompt for comments

## Anti-Patterns (AVOID)

- Generic openings: "Hey guys, welcome back to my channel" - boring, skipped instantly
- Vague promises: "This will change your life" - no credibility, feels like clickbait
- Buried value: Saving the good stuff for the end - viewers leave before payoff
- Monologue blocks: 5+ minutes of talking head without visual change - causes drop-off
- Weak CTAs: "Don't forget to subscribe" - no reason given, easily ignored
- Over-promising thumbnails: Content that doesn't match the thumbnail - damages retention rate
- Info dumping: 10 points when 3 would be memorable - dilutes impact
- Missing loops: Starting topics without creating curiosity - no reason to keep watching

## Examples

### Example 1: Tech Review Script (12 minutes)

**Input:** Write a script for a 12-minute review of the M4 MacBook Pro for video editors

**Output:**

```
SCRIPT: M4 MacBook Pro Review - Video Editor Verdict
Target: 12 minutes | ~1800 words
Thumbnail: Split screen - frustration face (left) / relief face (right)
First line: "I exported the same 4K timeline on five different laptops."

[VISUAL: Laptop screen showing export progress bar jumping from 10% to 100%]
"I exported the same 4K timeline on five different laptops."

[0:05-0:15] PROMISE
"And after three weeks of testing, I can tell you exactly which
creators should buy this M4 MacBook Pro - and which ones are
wasting their money."

[0:15-0:25] CREDIBILITY
"I've edited over 500 videos on MacBooks since 2019. I've owned every
M-series chip. And I've burned through $40,000 in Apple hardware
finding out what actually matters for video work."

[0:25-0:30] LOOP OPEN
"But there's one result from my testing that completely changed my
recommendation - and it's not about speed."

[B-ROLL: Quick montage of all test laptops, export times flashing on screen]

---

[0:30-2:00] SECTION 1: THE TEST SETUP

[RETENTION TRIGGER: "Before I show you the results..."]

"Before I show you the results, you need to understand how I tested this.
I used three real projects from my actual client work:

1. A 15-minute documentary with 4K ProRes footage
2. A 3-minute commercial with heavy color grading
3. A 45-minute podcast with multicam and graphics

Same projects. Same settings. Five laptops. Here's what matters..."

[B-ROLL: Screen recording of each project timeline, quick cuts]

ENGAGEMENT: "Drop a comment - which project type matches YOUR work?"

---

[2:00-5:00] SECTION 2: RAW PERFORMANCE NUMBERS

[RETENTION TRIGGER: "Now, the numbers surprised me..."]

"The M4 Pro exported that documentary in 8 minutes 12 seconds.
The M3 Pro? 11 minutes 40 seconds.
The M2 Pro? 14 minutes 22 seconds.

That's a 30% improvement from M3 to M4. But here's where it gets
interesting..."

[Continue with specific benchmark comparisons, thermal performance,
sustained workloads, memory pressure data]

---

[5:00-8:00] SECTION 3: WHAT THE BENCHMARKS MISS

[RETENTION TRIGGER: "But those numbers hide the real story..."]

"Benchmarks measure export times. But editors don't live in exports.
We live in the timeline. And that's where the M4's memory bandwidth
changes everything..."

[Detailed analysis of real-time playback, effects stacking,
multicam editing fluidity with specific examples]

---

[8:00-10:30] SECTION 4: THE RECOMMENDATION FRAMEWORK

"So who should actually buy this? I've made a simple decision tree..."

[Clear breakdown: If you do X, buy Y. If you do Z, buy W.
Specific use cases with specific recommendations]

[10:30-12:00] CLOSING

[LOOP PAYOFF]
"Remember that result I mentioned that changed my recommendation?
It's battery life during sustained exports. The M4 Pro maintains
performance on battery better than any laptop I've tested. For
location editors, that's worth more than any benchmark."

VALUE RECAP:
- M4 Pro: 30% faster exports vs M3, essential for daily editors
- 36GB RAM minimum for 4K ProRes workflows
- Battery performance is the hidden winner for mobile editors

[SUBSCRIBE CTA]
"If this helped you decide, subscribe. I'm testing the M4 Max
next month with 8K RED footage - and you'll want to see whether
the extra $1,000 is worth it for cinema-grade work."

### Example 2: Educational/Tutorial Script (8 minutes)

**Input:** Write a script teaching email marketing basics for small business owners

**Output:**

```
SCRIPT: Email Marketing That Actually Works (For Small Business)
Target: 8 minutes | ~1200 words
Thumbnail: Screenshot of email analytics showing 45% open rate + shocked face
First line: "My last email made $4,200 from 847 subscribers."

"I'm going to show you the exact three-email sequence that generated
that - and you can steal it. I'll give you the templates, the timing,
and the subject line formulas."

[0:15-0:25] CREDIBILITY
"I've run email marketing for 23 different small businesses.
I've sent over 2 million emails. Most businesses are doing
this completely wrong."

[0:25-0:30] LOOP OPEN
"And the biggest mistake? It's probably something you learned from
a marketing guru who's never actually run a small business."

---

[0:30-2:30] SECTION 1: THE FATAL MISTAKE

[RETENTION TRIGGER: "Let me show you what NOT to do..."]

"Most small businesses send what I call 'announcement emails.'
'We're having a sale.' 'Check out our new product.' 'Happy holidays.'

These emails average 8-12% open rates. My emails average 42%.
The difference is the first email you send..."

[Explain welcome sequence, relationship building, value-first approach]

[B-ROLL: Side-by-side comparison of bad vs good email examples]

ENGAGEMENT: "What's YOUR current open rate? Be honest in the comments."

---

[2:30-5:00] SECTION 2: THE THREE-EMAIL SEQUENCE

"Here's the exact sequence. I'm putting templates in the description.

Email 1: The 'One Weird Thing' Email
Subject: [Something unexpected about your industry]
Structure: Story hook > Counterintuitive insight > One actionable tip > Soft CTA

Email 2: The 'Behind The Curtain' Email
Subject: How we [specific process or result]
Structure: Process reveal > Mistakes you made > What you'd do differently > Social proof

Email 3: The 'Exclusive Offer' Email
Subject: [Name], I made something for you
Structure: Problem reminder > Solution intro > Clear offer > Deadline"

[Walk through each email with actual examples from real campaigns]

---

[5:00-7:00] SECTION 3: TIMING AND TOOLS

"When do you send these? What tools do you actually need?

For timing, I test everything. But across 23 businesses, Tuesday at
10am and Thursday at 2pm consistently outperform..."

[Specific recommendations for email platforms, list building, segmentation]

[7:00-8:00] CLOSING

[LOOP PAYOFF]
"That mistake I mentioned from the marketing gurus? It's 'nurture
before you sell.' Sounds right, but small businesses don't have
6 months to nurture. The three-email sequence I showed you generates
revenue by week two."

VALUE RECAP:
- Welcome sequence matters more than newsletters
- Three emails: Insight, Process, Offer
- Test timing but start with Tuesday/Thursday

[SUBSCRIBE CTA]
"I'm building a free email marketing course for small business owners -
subscribe and hit the bell to get notified when it drops next month."

### Example 3: Short-Form Script (60 seconds)

**Input:** Write a 60-second YouTube Short about productivity for remote workers

**Output:**

```
SCRIPT: The 2-Minute Rule That Fixed My Remote Work (Short)
Target: 55-60 seconds | ~160 words
Hook frame: Person at desk surrounded by sticky notes, head in hands
First line: "I was drowning in tasks until I tried this."

---

[0:00-0:03] HOOK
[VISUAL: Overwhelmed at desk, then cut to confident typing]
"I was drowning in tasks until I tried this."

[0:03-0:12] THE PROBLEM
"Remote work means endless small tasks. Reply to that Slack.
Update that doc. Send that email. And each one feels urgent
but nothing gets done."

[0:12-0:25] THE RULE
"The 2-minute rule: If a task takes less than 2 minutes, do it
immediately. Don't add it to a list. Don't schedule it. Just do it."

[B-ROLL: Quick cuts of completing small tasks - sending message,
updating document, replying to email]

[0:25-0:40] THE RESULT
"I cleared 47 tiny tasks in my first week. My to-do list went from
overwhelming to actually achievable. And my 'deep work' blocks
stopped getting interrupted by guilt about those small things."

[0:40-0:55] THE TWIST
"But here's the catch: if it takes more than 2 minutes, you
batch it. You schedule it. You protect your focus time.
The rule only works if you stick to the time limit."

[0:55-0:60] CTA
[TEXT ON SCREEN: "Follow for more remote work tips"]
"Try it tomorrow. Tell me how many tasks you clear."
```
