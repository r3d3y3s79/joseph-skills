OPENING (0-10 minutes):

[HOOK - First 60 seconds]
"Two years ago, I was charging $50 for blog posts and wondering if I'd ever make this freelance thing work.

Last month, I made $18,000. Same skill. Same me. Completely different approach.

Today, I'm going to show you exactly what changed—and how you can do the same thing, faster than I did."

[INTRO]
"For those who don't know me, I'm [Name]. I've been a freelance copywriter for 5 years. My work has generated over $4 million in sales for my clients. And I've helped over 300 copywriters build profitable freelance businesses.

But here's what matters: I'm going to teach you the same strategies I use. No fluff. No theory. Just what actually works to get paying clients."

[HOUSEKEEPING]
"Here's how today works:
- We'll be together for about 60 minutes
- I'm going to teach for most of that—real strategies you can use immediately
- At the end, I'll tell you about a program I have if you want to go deeper
- Stay until the end because I've got a special bonus only for live attendees
- Questions? Drop them in chat. I'll answer what I can as we go."

[AGENDA]
"Here's what we're covering:

1. The $50 vs $5,000 Client Secret: Why some copywriters are broke and others are booked
2. The Reverse Pitch Method: How to get clients coming to you
3. The Portfolio Shortcut: Look experienced before you have experience
4. Plus, a special offer for taking action today

Let's dive in."

---

TEACHING SECTION (10-35 minutes):

[CONTENT BLOCK 1: The Problem]
"Here's the biggest mistake I see copywriters make—and I made it too.

They compete on price.

They see other copywriters charging $50 for a blog post, so they charge $40. Race to the bottom.

But here's what nobody tells you: The clients who pay $50 per post aren't the same clients who pay $1,000 per post.

Different clients. Different platforms. Different conversations.

Let me show you what I mean...

[Story: My first $3,000 client vs. all my $50 clients combined]

The $3,000 client found me on LinkedIn—not Upwork. They asked about results—not price. They wanted a partner—not a vendor.

That's the shift. You're not raising prices. You're changing markets."

[CONTENT BLOCK 2: The Framework]
"So how do you find these better clients? I use what I call the Reverse Pitch Method.

Instead of pitching clients, you create content that attracts them to you.

Here's how it works:

Step 1: Pick your niche (narrow beats broad)
You don't say 'I'm a copywriter.' You say 'I write sales pages for online course creators.'

Step 2: Create proof content (show, don't tell)
One LinkedIn post per day showing your thinking. Case studies. Breakdowns. Tips.

Step 3: Make the next step obvious
Every piece of content ends with 'DM me if you need X.'

I landed my first $5,000 client from a LinkedIn post that took 20 minutes to write. That's the power of attraction vs. chasing.

Quick win you can do today: Post one breakdown of a sales page you admire. Tag the company. Explain why it works. Do this once a week for a month—watch what happens."

[CONTENT BLOCK 3: Proof]
"Does this actually work? Let me show you some results.

[Case Study 1]: Sarah started with zero clients 8 months ago. She followed this exact method. Today: $8,500/month, 4 retainer clients, 15-hour work weeks.

[Case Study 2]: Marcus was stuck at $2K/month for two years. Implemented the Reverse Pitch Method. Six months later: $14K month.

Why does this work? Because you're demonstrating value before asking for money. By the time someone reaches out, they already trust you. The sale is 80% made."

---

TRANSITION (35-40 minutes):

[RECAP]
"Let's recap what we covered:

1. Stop competing on price—change markets instead
2. Use the Reverse Pitch Method to attract clients
3. Your content is your portfolio

This alone can double your income. I've seen it happen dozens of times."

[GAP]
"But here's what I couldn't cover in 60 minutes:

- Exactly what to say on sales calls to close $3,000+ projects
- How to structure retainers so clients pay monthly (recurring income)
- The proposal template I use that converts 70% of calls to clients
- How to scope projects so you're not undercharging

This is the stuff that takes you from 'making money' to 'building wealth.'

And if you want to go deeper, I built something that gives you the complete system."

All tasks, who's responsible, what's overdue. This view alone saves our users hours of status meetings."

[Demonstrate]

### Example 3: Free Training Webinar (Lead Nurture)

**Input**: Write a free educational webinar about email marketing basics to build my list

**Output**:
```
WEBINAR OVERVIEW:
- Title: Email Marketing 101: Build Your First List in 30 Days
- Duration: 45 minutes
- Format: Live educational
- Goal: Build authority, grow email list, soft pitch newsletter
- Offer: Free email template pack (lead magnet for non-subscribers)

---

PRE-WEBINAR:
- Registration page headline: Email Marketing 101: Build Your First List in 30 Days (Free Workshop)
- Key promise: Leave with a clear plan to start your email list—even if you have zero subscribers
- 3 bullet points:
  - The simplest email platform setup (takes 20 minutes)
  - How to get your first 100 subscribers without ads
  - The one email type that builds trust fastest

---

OPENING (0-5 minutes):

[HOOK]
"If you've been putting off starting an email list because it feels complicated, today's the day that changes.

By the time we're done, you'll have a simple plan to go from zero to 100 subscribers in the next 30 days. No tech overwhelm. No expensive tools. Just the basics that actually work."

[INTRO]
"I'm [Name]. I've built an email list of 25,000 subscribers over the past 4 years, and it's become my most valuable business asset.

But I remember being at zero. I remember the confusion. That's exactly who this workshop is for."

[HOUSEKEEPING]
"Here's how today works:
- 35 minutes of teaching—step by step
- No fluff, no pitches—just education
- Q&A at the end
- At the end, I've got a free template pack for everyone
- Let's get into it."

---

TEACHING SECTION (5-35 minutes):

[CONTENT BLOCK 1: Why Email Still Wins]
"Quick reality check: Why email in 2026?

Social media followers aren't yours. Algorithm changes, account bans—gone.

Email subscribers? You own that list. You can contact them anytime. No algorithm decides who sees it.

Here's a stat: Email converts 3-5x better than social media. That's not opinion—that's data.

Even a small list of 500 engaged subscribers beats 10,000 Instagram followers for most businesses.

Today, we're building the foundation."

[CONTENT BLOCK 2: The Simple Setup]
"Step one: Pick your platform.

You don't need fancy. You need functional.

My recommendations for beginners:
- ConvertKit: Best for creators, free up to 1,000 subscribers
- MailerLite: Free up to 1,000, simple interface
- Beehiiv: Great for newsletters, free to start

Pick one. Sign up takes 5 minutes. Don't overthink this.

Step two: Create ONE opt-in form.

Not five. Not a popup and a sidebar and an exit intent. One form.

Put it somewhere visible: your homepage, your bio link, wherever your audience already is.

Step three: Write your welcome email.

This is the first email someone gets when they subscribe. Keep it simple:
- Thank them
- Tell them what to expect
- Give them one quick win

That's your setup. Took 20 minutes. You're ready to grow."

[CONTENT BLOCK 3: Getting Your First 100]
"Now the fun part: Getting subscribers.

Forget paid ads. Forget complicated funnels. Here are 3 ways to get your first 100:

Method 1: The Direct Ask
Post on social media: 'I'm starting an email newsletter about [topic]. If you want [benefit], drop your email in the comments or click the link in my bio.'

Sounds too simple? It works. Your existing audience is your first subscribers.

Method 2: The Content Upgrade
Have a popular blog post, video, or social thread? Create a downloadable version.

'Liked this thread? I turned it into a PDF checklist. Get it here [link].'

Method 3: The Collaboration
Find someone with a similar audience. Offer to write a guest post or be on their podcast. Include your opt-in link.

One collaboration can bring 50+ subscribers overnight.

Do these three things consistently for 30 days. You'll hit 100 subscribers."

[CONTENT BLOCK 4: The One Email Type That Builds Trust]
"Once you have subscribers, what do you send?

Here's the email type that works best for building relationships: The Personal Story + Lesson.

Structure:
- Short personal story (2-3 sentences)
- What you learned from it
- How the reader can apply it

Example:
'Last week I almost quit my podcast. Downloads were down. Energy was low. Then I got an email from a listener saying the show helped her start her business. Reminded me: numbers don't matter, impact does. What's one thing you're doing that's creating impact even if the metrics don't show it?'

That email took 10 minutes to write. It got 47 replies.

This is how you build a relationship with your list—not by selling, by connecting."

---

WRAP-UP (35-42 minutes):

[RECAP]
"Quick recap—here's your 30-day email list plan:

Week 1: Set up your platform, create one opt-in form, write your welcome email
Week 2-3: Direct ask, content upgrade, one collaboration
Week 4: Send your first 2-3 emails using the Personal Story + Lesson format

That's it. Simple beats complicated. Consistency beats perfection."
