## Examples

### Example 1: Interview Episode

**Input**: Create show notes for an interview with a startup founder about bootstrapping their company to $1M ARR

**Output**:

EPISODE INFO:
Title: From Side Project to $1M ARR: How Sarah Chen Bootstrapped DataSync
Episode Number: #47
Guest: Sarah Chen, Founder of DataSync
Duration: 58:32
Release Date: March 3, 2026

---

SHOW NOTES:

Sarah Chen bootstrapped DataSync from a side project to $1M ARR in 18 months without taking a dollar of outside funding. In this episode, she breaks down her exact playbook - from the first paying customer to building a team of 8.

KEY TOPICS & TIMESTAMPS:
[00:00] - Introduction and Sarah's background
[03:45] - The problem that sparked DataSync
[08:20] - Getting the first 10 customers (cold outreach that worked)
[15:30] - Pricing mistakes and how she fixed them
[22:15] - When to quit your job and go full-time
[29:40] - Hiring the first employee (what she'd do differently)
[38:10] - The $1M ARR milestone - what actually changed
[45:25] - Advice for bootstrappers starting today
[52:30] - Rapid fire questions
[56:00] - Where to find Sarah

GUEST BIO:
Sarah Chen is the founder of DataSync, a data pipeline tool for small teams. Before starting DataSync, she spent 8 years as a data engineer at companies including Stripe and Plaid. She writes the Bootstrap Weekly newsletter to 15,000+ subscribers.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
1. Your first 10 customers should come from personal outreach, not marketing
2. Charge more than you think - Sarah 3x'd her prices and lost zero customers
3. Don't hire until the pain of not hiring outweighs the pain of hiring
4. The gap between $0 and $10K MRR is harder than $10K to $100K
5. Build in public - Sarah's Twitter threads drove 40% of early signups

NOTABLE QUOTES:
"I charged $29/month for 6 months before someone told me the tool was worth $200. They would have paid $200 on day one." - Sarah Chen

"Everyone says 'talk to customers.' What they don't say is that 90% of those conversations feel useless. The 10% that matter will change everything." - Sarah Chen

```
EPISODE INFO:
Title: Will AI Replace Creatives? 4 Experts Debate
Episode Number: #100 (Special Episode)
Guests: Maya Rodriguez (Designer), James Liu (Writer), Dr. Aisha Patel (AI Researcher), Marcus Thompson (Creative Director)
Duration: 1:12:45
Release Date: March 10, 2026

---

SHOW NOTES:

For our 100th episode, we brought together four experts from different creative fields to debate the big question: Will AI replace creatives, or is it just another tool?

A designer, a writer, an AI researcher, and a creative director walk into a podcast... and disagree on almost everything. This is the honest, nuanced conversation the AI discourse needs.

KEY TOPICS & TIMESTAMPS:
[00:00] - Introductions and each guest's AI hot take
[06:30] - Where AI is genuinely useful right now
[15:45] - Where AI falls short (specific examples)
[24:20] - The "good enough" problem for creative work
[33:10] - Will clients pay for human creativity?
[42:30] - Which creative jobs are most/least at risk
[51:15] - How each guest is adapting their workflow
[59:40] - Predictions for 2030
[1:08:00] - Final thoughts and advice

GUEST BIOS:

Maya Rodriguez - Lead designer at a Fortune 500 company, 15 years in brand and product design. Vocal critic of AI-generated design.

James Liu - Bestselling author and screenwriter. Recently used AI tools for his latest novel's research phase.

Dr. Aisha Patel - AI researcher at MIT, specializing in generative models. Provides technical context others can't.

Marcus Thompson - Creative director at an agency handling $50M+ campaigns. Sees both sides daily.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
1. "Replace" is the wrong framing - "reshape" is more accurate (consensus)
2. AI excels at iteration and variation, struggles with genuine innovation (Maya)
3. The market may not care about "authentically human" unless we make it care (James)
4. Most AI limitations today are temporary, not fundamental (Dr. Patel)
5. Agencies are already cutting junior roles - the impact is happening now (Marcus)

NOTABLE QUOTES:
"AI can generate a thousand logo variations. It can't tell you which one matters." - Maya Rodriguez

"My fear isn't that AI writes better than humans. It's that most clients can't tell the difference." - James Liu

"We're asking the wrong question. It's not 'can AI create?' It's 'what do humans uniquely bring?' That's harder to answer than we'd like." - Dr. Aisha Patel

"I've seen two reactions: creatives who are learning AI, and creatives who are scared. One group has job security." - Marcus Thompson
