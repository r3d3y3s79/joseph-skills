# Content Repurposer

## Overview

One piece of content should become many. This skill helps you transform content between formats - blog to thread, video to article, podcast to newsletter - while adapting the message to each platform's unique strengths and audience expectations.

## When to Use

- Converting blog posts to Twitter threads
- Turning videos into written articles
- Extracting newsletter content from podcasts
- Creating social posts from long-form content
- Building content libraries from existing assets
- Maximizing ROI on content you've already made

## Output Structure

```
SOURCE CONTENT:
Format: [Blog/Video/Podcast/Newsletter/etc.]
Title: [Original title]
Core Message: [1-2 sentence summary]
Key Points: [Bullet list of main ideas]

---

REPURPOSED VERSION:

TARGET FORMAT: [New format]
TARGET PLATFORM: [Where it will be published]

[ADAPTED CONTENT]
[Content restructured and rewritten for new format]
[Same core value, different delivery]

---

ADAPTATION NOTES:
- What was kept: [Core elements preserved]
- What was changed: [Format-specific adjustments]
- What was added: [Platform-specific elements like CTAs, hashtags]
- What was removed: [Elements that don't translate]
```

## Quick Reference

| Transformation | Key Changes |
|---------------|-------------|
| Blog → Thread | Break into single ideas, add hook, number posts |
| Video → Article | Add structure, remove verbal tics, cite visuals |
| Podcast → Newsletter | Extract highlights, add links, write transitions |
| Long-form → Carousel | Visual focus, one idea per slide, design space |
| Article → Video Script | Add personality, remove dense paragraphs, verbal flow |
| Newsletter → LinkedIn | Professional tone, remove casual, add credibility |

## Transformation Types

### Blog → Twitter Thread
- Extract 7-12 key points
- Lead with strongest hook
- One idea per tweet
- End with CTA

### Video → Blog Article
- Transcribe and restructure
- Add headers for skimmability
- Replace "as you can see" with descriptions
- Embed the video

### Podcast → Newsletter
- Pull top 3-5 insights
- Add your commentary
- Link to full episode
- Include timestamps

### Long-form → Carousel
- One concept per slide
- Strong visual hierarchy
- End with CTA slide
- Design for mobile first

### Any → Pull Quotes
- Find 3-5 quotable moments
- Make them standalone
- Format for image graphics
- Include attribution

## Common Mistakes

- **Copy-paste without adapting**: Each format has different rules
- **Losing the hook**: Reintroduce context for new audience
- **Keeping everything**: Trim ruthlessly for new format
- **Ignoring platform norms**: LinkedIn isn't Twitter isn't Instagram
- **Forgetting the CTA**: Always guide next action
- **Not crediting the source**: Link back to original when appropriate

## Examples

### Example 1: Blog Post to Twitter Thread

**Input**: Repurpose this blog post section about productivity systems into a Twitter thread

Source: "The problem with most productivity systems is they're designed by productivity nerds, for productivity nerds. They assume you have unlimited time to maintain the system itself. Real productivity is boring: do the most important thing first, eliminate distractions, and stop when you're done. You don't need 47 apps. You need discipline and a simple list."

**Output**:
```

Title: Why Your Productivity System Doesn't Work
Core Message: Simple beats complex for real productivity
Key Points:
- Most systems are overcomplicated
- Systems require maintenance time
- Simplicity wins in practice
- Discipline matters more than tools

THREAD:

1/7
Most productivity systems fail for one reason:

They're designed by productivity nerds, for productivity nerds.

Here's what actually works:

2/7
The problem with complex systems:

They require time to MAINTAIN the system itself.

You spend more time organizing tasks than doing them.

That's not productivity. That's procrastination with extra steps.

3/7
Real productivity is boring:

→ Do the most important thing first
→ Eliminate distractions
→ Stop when you're done

That's it. That's the system.

4/7
You don't need:
- 47 apps
- A second brain
- 8 different views
- Color-coded everything

You need:
- A simple list
- 2-3 hours of focus
- The discipline to start

5/7
The most productive people I know use:

- Paper notebooks
- Basic task apps
- Their calendar

They spend 5 minutes planning.
Then hours executing.

6/7
Complexity is a trap.

It feels like progress.
It looks impressive.
It produces nothing.

Simple is harder to sell, easier to do.

7/7
Your homework:

1. Delete one productivity app today
2. Write your top 3 tasks on paper tomorrow
3. Do the first one before checking email

That's more productive than any system.

ADAPTATION NOTES:
- What was kept: Core message that simple beats complex
- What was changed: Broke into single-tweet ideas, added line breaks, created rhythm
- What was added: Thread numbering, homework CTA, specific examples
- What was removed: Paragraph structure, transitions between ideas
```

### Example 2: Podcast Episode to Newsletter

**Input**: Repurpose key insights from a podcast interview about freelancing into a newsletter

Source: 45-minute interview with a freelancer who went from $50/hour to $500/hour over 3 years. Key topics: specialization, positioning, charging by value not time, firing bad clients, building productized services.

**Output**:

PREVIEW TEXT: 4 lessons from a freelancer who 10x'd their income

---

Quick one today—

I just recorded a podcast with a freelancer who went from $50/hour to $500/hour.

No trust fund. No lucky break. Just strategy.

Here are the 4 moves that made the difference:

## 1. She Specialized (Ruthlessly)

At $50/hour, she was a "web designer."

At $500/hour, she's "the conversion expert for B2B SaaS landing pages."

Same skills. Different positioning. 10x the rate.

The lesson: When you can do everything, you're compared to everyone. When you do one thing, you're the obvious choice.

## 2. She Stopped Charging by the Hour

"How long will this take?" is the wrong question.

"What is this worth to the client?" is the right one.

A landing page that takes her 10 hours but generates $100K in revenue? That's not a $500 job. That's a $10,000 job.

Value pricing requires confidence. But it changes everything.

## 3. She Fired Bad Clients

The math seems wrong: "I can't afford to fire a $5K client."

But bad clients:
- Take 3x the time
- Kill your energy
- Block better opportunities

She fired her worst client. Within a month, she had two better ones.

## 4. She Productized Her Service

Instead of custom everything, she created a fixed-scope "Landing Page Sprint":
- 2 weeks
- Fixed deliverables
- Fixed price

Clients love clarity. She loves predictability. Win-win.

### Example 3: YouTube Video to LinkedIn Article

**Input**: Repurpose a YouTube video about remote work management into a LinkedIn article

Source: 12-minute video titled "Managing Remote Teams: What I Learned Leading 50+ People Across 8 Time Zones"

**Output**:
```
SOURCE CONTENT:
Format: YouTube video
Title: Managing Remote Teams: What I Learned Leading 50+ People Across 8 Time Zones
Core Message: Remote management requires intentional systems for communication, culture, and accountability
Key Points:
- Async communication by default
- Over-communicate context, not tasks
- Build culture through rituals
- Trust but verify with transparent metrics
- Time zones require creative meeting schedules

TARGET PLATFORM: LinkedIn

ARTICLE:

TITLE: What I Learned Managing 50+ People Across 8 Time Zones

I've managed remote teams for 5 years. At our peak, 50+ people across 8 time zones.

Some things worked. Many didn't. Here's what I'd tell my past self.

---

**1. Default to Async (Seriously)**

Meetings feel productive. They're usually not.

We implemented a rule: No meeting without a written agenda. No agenda? It becomes a Loom video instead.

Result: Meeting hours dropped 60%. Decisions actually improved because people had time to think.

The exception: 1:1s, brainstorms, and conflict resolution. Some conversations need real-time.

**2. Over-Communicate Context, Not Tasks**

Remote workers can't overhear office conversations. They miss context constantly.

Bad: "Update the landing page"
Good: "We're seeing 30% drop-off on the landing page. Marketing thinks the headline isn't connecting. Can you propose 3 alternatives by Thursday? Here's the analytics link."

More context = fewer clarifying questions = faster work.

**3. Culture Doesn't Just Happen**

In an office, culture is ambient. Remote, it's invisible unless you make it visible.

What worked for us:
- Weekly "wins" thread (celebrates small victories)
- Monthly virtual coffee roulette (pairs random teammates)
- Annual in-person meetup (non-negotiable budget item)

What didn't work: Mandatory fun. Forced Slack games. Anything that felt like homework.

**4. Trust But Verify (Transparently)**

Micromanagement kills remote work. But "I trust you completely" with no visibility isn't management.

The balance: Transparent metrics everyone can see.

We used a simple dashboard:
- Key projects and status
- Blockers (flagged by the team, not managers)
- Weekly output (defined by each role)

No checking up. No surveillance software. Just visibility.

**5. Time Zones Require Creativity**

With 8 time zones, there's no perfect meeting time.

Our solutions:
- Rotate meeting times so the same people aren't always inconvenienced
- Record everything (seriously, everything)
- Make synchronous time sacred (no multitasking allowed)
- Respect local time (no pinging at midnight)

The hardest part: Accepting that some conversations will be 24+ hour async threads. That's okay.

---

**The Uncomfortable Truth**

Remote management is harder than in-person management.

Not because people slack off at home (they don't). Because the easy parts of in-office work—ambient awareness, casual check-ins, reading body language—require systems when remote.

You either build those systems or you fail at remote.
