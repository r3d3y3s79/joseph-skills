# Blog SEO Writer

Create blog posts built to rank in search results and convert readers to customers. This skill combines search intent analysis with conversion copywriting to produce articles that satisfy both algorithms and humans.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Writing pillar content targeting competitive keywords
- Creating supporting content for topic clusters
- Producing product comparison or review articles
- Drafting how-to guides and tutorials
- Writing thought leadership pieces with search visibility goals

## Output Structure

### SEO Header Block
Each article begins with:
- Primary keyword and search volume estimate
- Search intent classification (informational, commercial, transactional, navigational)
- Recommended URL slug
- Meta title (under 60 characters, keyword near front)
- Meta description (under 155 characters, includes keyword and CTA)
- Target word count based on SERP analysis

### Content Outline
Before the full article:
- H1 headline with primary keyword
- H2/H3 structure matching search intent
- Target keywords for each section
- Internal linking opportunities noted
- Featured snippet targets marked

### Article Body
Structured with:
- Introduction with keyword in first 100 words
- Logical H2/H3 hierarchy (no heading skips)
- Keyword variations naturally integrated
- Lists and tables for featured snippet targeting
- Specific examples and data points
- Internal link anchors marked: [[link: anchor text -> target page]]
- External reference opportunities noted

### Conversion Elements
- Call-to-action placement recommendations
- Email capture opportunity points
- Product/service mention locations
- Social proof integration points

### Technical Appendix
- Schema markup suggestions (FAQ, HowTo, Article)
- Image alt text recommendations
- Related keywords for future content

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing output, verify:
- [ ] Primary keyword appears in H1, first 100 words, and one H2
- [ ] Meta title under 60 characters, meta description under 155 characters
- [ ] Each H2 section is 200-400 words (not too thin or bloated)
- [ ] At least one list or table per 500 words (scanability)
- [ ] All claims have specific data, examples, or sources
- [ ] Internal linking opportunities marked (minimum 3)
- [ ] Introduction hooks reader with problem/promise (not background)
- [ ] Conclusion has clear CTA (not just summary)
- [ ] Reading level appropriate for audience (typically Grade 8-10)
- [ ] No keyword stuffing (natural density 1-2%)

## Anti-Patterns (AVOID)

- Keyword stuffing: Forcing the keyword into every paragraph reads unnaturally and triggers spam filters
- Thin H2 sections: 50-word sections signal low-quality content to search engines
- Wall-of-text paragraphs: No formatting, no lists, no scannability equals high bounce rate
- Generic introductions: "In today's world..." or "Many people wonder..." wastes reader attention
- Unsupported claims: "Studies show..." without citing which studies damages credibility
- Missing internal links: Leaving page equity on the table and failing to build topic authority
- Over-optimization: Exact-match keywords in every heading looks manipulative
- Ignoring search intent: Writing informational content for transactional keywords misses conversions
- Forgetting mobile: Long paragraphs and complex tables break on mobile (60% of traffic)

## Examples

**Input:** Write a blog post targeting "best project management software for small teams" (commercial intent, 1500 words)

# Best Project Management Software for Small Teams in 2026

Your team is drowning in Slack messages, email threads, and forgotten tasks. You need project management software that actually works for a small team - not enterprise bloatware that requires a full-time admin.

After testing 23 project management tools across three months with a 7-person marketing team, I've narrowed it down to seven that actually make sense for small teams (under 20 people).

[[link: project management basics -> /guides/project-management-fundamentals]]

---

## How We Evaluated These Tools

Before diving into recommendations, here's what matters for small teams:

**Evaluation Criteria:**
| Factor | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| Setup time | Small teams can't spare a week for onboarding |
| Per-user pricing | Budget constraints are real |
| Learning curve | No dedicated admin to train people |
| Core features | Task management, deadlines, collaboration |
| Integration depth | Must work with existing tools |

Each tool was tested with real projects over 4 weeks. I tracked:
- Time to complete first project setup
- User adoption (did the team actually use it?)
- Tasks that fell through the cracks
- Integration friction with Slack, Google, and Zoom

## Quick Comparison Table

[FEATURED SNIPPET TARGET - TABLE]

| Tool | Best For | Starting Price | Free Plan | Setup Time |
|------|----------|----------------|-----------|------------|
| Monday.com | Overall | $9/user/mo | 2 users | 30 min |
| Notion | Budget | $8/user/mo | Generous | 45 min |
| Basecamp | Remote | $99/mo flat | No | 20 min |
| Linear | Tech teams | $8/user/mo | Free tier | 15 min |
| ClickUp | Features | $7/user/mo | Yes | 60 min |
| Trello | Free | $5/user/mo | Yes | 10 min |
| Asana | Scaling | $10.99/user/mo | 15 users | 35 min |

---

## Best Overall: Monday.com

**Why it wins:** Monday.com hits the sweet spot between power and simplicity. Your team can start using it within 30 minutes, but it scales as you grow.

**Pricing:** $9/user/month (Standard plan) | Free for 2 users

**What we liked:**
- Automations that actually work (saved 3 hours/week in our test)
- Visual boards that non-technical team members understand
- Templates that don't feel like demos
- Mobile app that matches desktop functionality

**What we didn't:**
- Gets expensive fast as team grows
- Some features feel hidden behind extra clicks
- Advanced automations require higher plans

**Verdict:** If you want one tool that does 80% of what you need without configuration, Monday.com is it. The price premium is justified by time saved.

## Best for Budget-Conscious Teams: Notion

**Why it wins:** Notion gives you project management, documentation, and wikis in one tool. For teams already paying for separate tools, the consolidation saves money.

**Pricing:** $8/user/month (Plus plan) | Free tier is genuinely usable

[Continue with same depth for each tool: specific features, real pricing, honest limitations, clear verdict]

## How to Choose the Right Tool

Forget feature comparison lists. Answer these three questions:

**1. What's your primary bottleneck?**
- Tasks getting lost → Trello or Monday.com
- Communication scattered → Basecamp
- Documentation chaos → Notion
- Development workflows → Linear

**2. What's your actual budget?**
- $0/month → Trello, ClickUp, or Notion free tiers
- Under $50/month → Basecamp (flat rate)
- Under $100/month → Any tool, 5-10 users
- Scaling budget → Asana or Monday.com

**3. How tech-savvy is your team?**
- Non-technical → Basecamp or Monday.com
- Mixed → ClickUp or Notion
- Developers → Linear

---

## Common Mistakes When Choosing PM Software

**Mistake 1: Buying based on features you'll never use**
Small teams don't need resource leveling, Gantt dependencies, or portfolio views. Pay for what you'll actually use.

**Mistake 2: Choosing the CEO's preference**
The people using the tool daily should pick it. Executive dashboards don't matter if your team won't open the app.

**Mistake 3: Skipping the trial period**
Every tool on this list offers a trial. Use it with real projects, not demo data.

---

## FAQ

[FEATURED SNIPPET TARGET - FAQ]

**What is the best free project management software for small teams?**
Trello offers the most usable free plan for basic task management. ClickUp's free tier has more features but a steeper learning curve. For teams under 15 people, Asana's free plan provides solid core functionality.

**How much should a small team spend on project management software?**
Budget $5-15 per user per month for adequate features. For a 10-person team, expect $50-150/month. Basecamp's flat $99/month rate becomes cost-effective at 7+ users.

**Can small teams use enterprise project management tools?**
Technically yes, but you'll waste time and money on features designed for 100+ person organizations. Tools like Jira or Microsoft Project have unnecessary complexity for small teams.

---

## Final Recommendation

For most small teams, start with Monday.com or Notion. Both offer enough free or trial time to validate the fit.

If budget is your primary constraint, Trello's free tier handles basic project management without limitations that frustrate your team.
