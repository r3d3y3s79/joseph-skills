3. **Solution**: Present your offer as the answer

### AIDA (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action)
1. **Attention**: Bold headline that stops scrolling
2. **Interest**: Engage with relevant problems/benefits
3. **Desire**: Build want through proof and transformation
4. **Action**: Clear, compelling CTA

### Before-After-Bridge
1. **Before**: Current painful state
2. **After**: Desired future state
3. **Bridge**: Your offer connects the two

PROBLEM SECTION:

SECTION HEADLINE: Your Email List Is Leaving Money on the Table

You built an email list. Good.

But let's be honest:
- Your open rates are dropping (and you don't know why)
- You stare at blank screens, unsure what to write
- When you DO email, nobody clicks or buys
- You feel guilty for not emailing more... but also dread it
- Other people make money from email. You make crickets.

Here's the truth: A dead email list isn't your fault. Nobody taught you how to write emails that actually work.

Until now.
