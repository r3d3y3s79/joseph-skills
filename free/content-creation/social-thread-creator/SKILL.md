# Social Thread Creator

## Overview

Create viral-worthy threads for Twitter/X and LinkedIn that hook readers, deliver value, and build your audience. This skill helps you structure multi-post content that keeps people reading until the end and compels them to engage.

## When to Use

- Writing Twitter/X threads (5-15 posts)
- Creating LinkedIn carousel content
- Sharing step-by-step tutorials
- Breaking down complex topics
- Telling stories that build authority
- Repurposing long-form content into threads

## Output Structure

```
THREAD TOPIC: [Main topic/angle]
PLATFORM: [Twitter/X or LinkedIn]
THREAD LENGTH: [Number of posts]

---

HOOK (Post 1):
[Attention-grabbing opener - the most important post]

POST 2:
[Context or setup - why this matters]

POSTS 3-N:
[Main content - tips, steps, insights]
[One idea per post]
[Use line breaks for readability]

SECOND-TO-LAST POST:
[Summary or key takeaway]

FINAL POST (CTA):
[Call-to-action: follow, repost, comment, link]

---

ENGAGEMENT BOOSTERS:
- Self-reply question: [Question to pin as first reply]
- Repost text: [Short version for sharing]
- Alt hook: [Alternative opener to test]
```

## Quick Reference

| Element | Twitter/X | LinkedIn |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Hook length | 1-2 sentences max | 2-3 sentences |
| Posts/slides | 7-12 ideal | 8-12 slides |
| Characters | 280 per post | 3,000 per post |
| Line breaks | Every 1-2 sentences | Every sentence |
| Emojis | Sparingly (1-2 per post) | More accepted |
| Hashtags | 0-1 per thread | 3-5 at end |
| CTA style | Direct ("Follow for more") | Professional |

## Thread Formats

### The Listicle
- Hook: "X things I learned about Y"
- Each post = one item
- Number each point
- Works for tips, lessons, mistakes

### The Story
- Hook: Dramatic moment or outcome
- Build chronologically
- Include conflict/tension
- End with lesson learned

### The How-To
- Hook: Promise specific result
- Step-by-step breakdown
- One step per post
- Include examples

### The Contrarian
- Hook: Challenge common belief
- Present your evidence
- Anticipate objections
- Offer alternative view

### The Case Study
- Hook: Impressive result
- Before/after context
- Exact process used
- Lessons for reader

## Common Mistakes

- **Weak hooks**: Post 1 makes or breaks everything
- **Too much per post**: One idea = one post
- **No line breaks**: Walls of text kill engagement
- **Burying the value**: Front-load the good stuff
- **Forgetting the CTA**: Always tell them what to do next
- **Over-hashtagging**: Looks spammy, reduces reach
- **No self-reply**: First reply should add value or ask a question

## Examples

### Example 1: Twitter/X Educational Thread

**Input**: Create a thread about writing better headlines for my copywriting audience

**Output**:
```
THREAD TOPIC: Headline writing fundamentals
PLATFORM: Twitter/X
THREAD LENGTH: 9 posts

---

HOOK (Post 1):
I've written 10,000+ headlines.

Here are 7 formulas that work every single time:

(save this thread)

POST 2:
First, understand this:

Your headline has ONE job:
Get them to read the next line.

That's it. Not to summarize. Not to be clever.
Just earn the click.

POST 3:
Formula 1: The "How To"

How to [achieve outcome] without [pain point]

Example:
"How to write sales pages without sounding salesy"

Simple. Clear. Works.

POST 4:
Formula 2: The Number List

[Number] [things] that [outcome]

Example:
"7 email subject lines that doubled my open rate"

Odd numbers perform better than even.

POST 5:
Formula 3: The Question

Use questions your reader is already asking themselves.

Example:
"Why does your copy sound like everyone else's?"

They can't help but read to find out.

POST 6:
Formula 4: The Mistake

[Number] [mistakes] that [negative outcome]

Example:
"5 landing page mistakes killing your conversions"

Fear of loss > promise of gain.

POST 7:
Formula 5: The Contrarian

[Common belief] is wrong. Here's why.

Example:
"Long copy doesn't convert. Here's what does."

Challenges create curiosity.

POST 8:
The two best headlines follow these rules:

1. Specific (use numbers, timeframes)
2. Benefit-focused (what's in it for them)
3. Curiosity-driven (incomplete information)

Use all three when possible.

POST 9 (CTA):
That's the 7 headline formulas I use daily.

### Example 2: LinkedIn Story Thread

**Input**: Write a LinkedIn post about failing at my first startup and what I learned

**Output**:
```
THREAD TOPIC: Startup failure lessons
PLATFORM: LinkedIn
THREAD LENGTH: 8 posts (carousel format)

---

HOOK (Slide 1):
I lost $50,000 and 2 years of my life on a startup that failed.

Here's what nobody tells you about failing:

It's the best thing that can happen to you.

SLIDE 2:
In 2019, I had a "brilliant" idea.

A marketplace for freelance designers.
(Original, I know.)

I quit my job.
Emptied my savings.
Built for 18 months.

Launched to... silence.

SLIDE 3:
What went wrong?

I built what I thought was cool.
Not what customers actually needed.

I never talked to a single potential user
before writing a line of code.

Classic first-time founder mistake.

SLIDE 4:
The money ran out. The cofounders left.

I had to move back in with my parents at 29.

Rock bottom.

But here's what I learned:

SLIDE 5:
LESSON 1: Talk to customers before building

10 customer calls would have saved me 18 months.

Now I don't write a single line of code until
I have 10+ people who say "I need this."

SLIDE 6:
LESSON 2: Start with revenue, not features

I obsessed over design. Perfect UI. Clean code.

None of it mattered without customers.

My second business: ugly landing page, 10 sales in week one.

SLIDE 7:
LESSON 3: Failure is tuition, not a verdict

That failed startup taught me more than my MBA.

Every successful founder I know has a failure story.
Most have several.

SLIDE 8 (CTA):
Three years later, I run a profitable business
doing exactly what I love.

Failure was the prerequisite, not the ending.

What's a failure that taught you something valuable?

Share in the comments - I read every one.

---

ENGAGEMENT BOOSTERS:
- Comment prompt: "What failure turned into your biggest lesson?"
- Repost text: "Why my startup failure was the best thing that happened to me"
- Alt hook: "I wasted 2 years building something nobody wanted."
```

### Example 3: Twitter/X How-To Thread

**Input**: Create a thread explaining how to use Claude Code for content creation

**Output**:
```
THREAD TOPIC: Claude Code for content creators
PLATFORM: Twitter/X
THREAD LENGTH: 11 posts

---

HOOK (Post 1):
Claude Code is the most powerful AI tool I've used.

But most people use it wrong.

Here's my exact workflow for creating a week of content in 2 hours:

POST 2:
First, forget ChatGPT habits.

Claude Code isn't a chatbot.
It's an AI that reads and writes files.

Big difference.

POST 3:
The magic: Custom Skills

Skills are reusable prompts that live on your machine.

Instead of re-explaining what you want every time,
you run a skill and it just works.

POST 4:
Step 1: Set up your content system

Create a folder structure:
/content
  /scripts
  /threads
  /newsletters

Claude Code will read/write directly to these.

POST 5:
Step 2: Create a brand voice file

Write a file called BRAND.md with:
- Your tone
- Topics you cover
- Words to use/avoid
- Example content

Claude reads this for every piece.

POST 6:
Step 3: Build reusable skills

Instead of prompting from scratch:
"/youtube-script [topic]"

One command. Consistent output. Every time.

POST 7:
My Monday workflow:

1. Run /content-ideas to generate 10 topics
2. Pick 5 winners
3. Run /youtube-script for each
4. Run /thread for Twitter versions
5. Run /newsletter for the roundup

POST 8:
Time investment:

Before Claude Code: 15+ hours/week on content
After: 2-3 hours/week

Same quality. Sometimes better.
(The AI doesn't have writer's block.)

POST 9:
Common mistakes I see:

- Generic prompting (be specific)
- No brand context (give it your voice)
- Manual copy-paste (use file operations)
- Starting over each session (use skills)

POST 10:
The result:

3x more content
1/5 the time
Better consistency

This is what I wish I knew 6 months ago.

POST 11 (CTA):
Want the full Claude Code content system?

I'm sharing my exact skills and workflow.

Follow @handle and reply "CLAUDE" - I'll send the link.

- Repost text: "How I create a week of content in 2 hours with Claude Code"
