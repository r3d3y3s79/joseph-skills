## Quick Reference

| Element | Best Practice |
|---------|--------------|
| First 150 characters | Most important - visible before "show more" |
| Total length | 200-500 words (longer ranks better) |
| Primary keyword | In first 25 words |
| Timestamps | Required for videos >10 minutes |
| Links | Limit to 3-5 most important |
| Hashtags | 3-5 max, first 3 show above title |
| CTA | One clear action (subscribe, click, watch) |

## Description Sections

### The Hook (First 2-3 Lines)
- Always visible in search results
- Include primary keyword naturally
- Promise specific value
- Create curiosity to click "show more"

### The Expansion
- Detailed overview of content
- Answer "what will I learn?"
- Include secondary keywords
- Establish credibility/context

### Timestamps (Chapters)
- Required for 10+ minute videos
- Start with 0:00
- Descriptive labels (not just "Part 1")
- Help YouTube understand content

### Resources Section
- Links mentioned in video
- Affiliate links (with FTC disclosure)
- Tools, products, downloads
- Keep organized and scannable

### Boilerplate (End)
- About the channel
- Subscribe CTA
- Social links
- Related videos

## Common Mistakes

- **Ignoring first 150 characters**: This is prime real estate
- **Keyword stuffing**: Write for humans, optimize for bots
- **No timestamps**: Hurts retention and SEO
- **Dead links**: Check links regularly
- **Missing disclosure**: Affiliate links need clear disclosure
- **Generic descriptions**: Each video needs unique content
- **No CTA**: Tell viewers what to do next
