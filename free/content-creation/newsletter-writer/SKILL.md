## Quick Reference

| Element | Best Practice |
|---------|--------------|
| Subject line | 6-10 words, create curiosity |
| Preview text | Complement subject, add context |
| Opener | Personal, specific, relatable |
| Sections | 2-3 max, clear headlines |
| CTA | One primary action |
| Length | 300-500 words ideal |
| Links | 3-5 max per newsletter |

## Newsletter Formats

### The Curator
- 3-5 links with your commentary
- Why each matters
- Your unique take

### The Teacher
- One main lesson
- Step-by-step breakdown
- Practical takeaway

### The Storyteller
- Personal anecdote
- Lesson embedded
- Reader connection

### The Hybrid
- Quick personal update
- Main value section
- Curated links

## Common Mistakes

- **Too many CTAs**: Stick to ONE primary action
- **Weak subject lines**: Test curiosity vs. clarity
- **No preview text**: Wasted real estate
- **Wall of text**: Use headers, bullets, whitespace
- **Generic opener**: "Hope you're doing well" = delete
- **Missing reply prompt**: Newsletters should feel like conversations

## Examples

### Example 1: Weekly Content Digest

**Input**: Write a newsletter for my YouTube audience about my new video on AI coding tools

**Output**:
```
SUBJECT LINE OPTIONS:
1. I mass tried every AI coding tool so you don't have to
2. The AI coding tool that actually delivers (+ 3 that don't)
3. Quick update: My honest take on AI coding tools

PREVIEW TEXT: After 40+ hours of testing, here's what actually works...

Hey friend,

Last week I mass-tested AI coding tools (so you don't have to).

40+ hours of testing. 7 tools. 1 clear winner.

## The Results Are In

Here's what surprised me: The most expensive tool wasn't the best. Not even close.

In this week's video, I break down:
→ Which tool actually speeds up coding (hint: it's free)
→ The $20/month tool that's basically a scam
→ My exact workflow for using AI without losing your skills

If you're short on time, here's the TL;DR:
1. Start with [Tool] for autocomplete
2. Use [Tool] for complex refactoring
3. Skip [Tool] entirely (here's why)

Let's talk SEO.

Not the complicated stuff. The 20% that gets 80% of results.

## The Only 3 Things That Actually Matter

After ranking dozens of articles, here's what moves the needle:

**1. Answer the actual question**
Google knows when you're padding word count. Write the answer first, then elaborate.

**2. Use the words people search**
If people search "best running shoes," don't title your article "optimal footwear for athletics."

**3. Get other sites to link to you**
One link from a real website beats 100 directory submissions.

That's it. Everything else is optimization.

## This Week's Quick Win

Go to Google Search Console. Find your pages ranking #4-10. Add 200 words of genuinely useful content to each.

You'll see movement within 2 weeks.
