## Quick Reference

| Element | Best Practice |
|---------|--------------|
| Executive summary | 200-300 words max |
| Pricing | 2-3 options (anchor high) |
| Timeline | Specific dates, not ranges |
| Deliverables | Tangible, measurable items |
| Validity | 14-30 days creates urgency |
| Length | 3-8 pages depending on scope |
| Tone | Professional but warm |

## Proposal Types

### The Quick Quote
- 1-2 pages
- Problem/solution/price
- For small projects under $5K

### The Standard Proposal
- 4-6 pages
- Full structure above
- For projects $5K-50K

### The Enterprise Proposal
- 8-15 pages
- Case studies, team bios, methodology
- For projects $50K+

### The Partnership Proposal
- Focus on mutual benefit
- Revenue sharing models
- Long-term vision

## Pricing Psychology

### Anchor High
Present your most comprehensive option first. The premium option makes the standard feel reasonable.

### Three Options
- Basic: What they asked for
- Standard: What they need (your target)
- Premium: What would transform their business

### Value Framing
Don't list hours. List outcomes. "Website redesign" vs. "Lead generation system that converts visitors into customers."

## Common Mistakes

- **Leading with features**: Start with their problem, not your solution
- **Buried pricing**: Don't make them hunt for costs
- **Vague deliverables**: "Strategy document" vs. "30-page go-to-market playbook"
- **No deadline**: Proposals without expiration dates die
- **One option only**: Multiple options increase close rates 30%+
- **Missing next steps**: Tell them exactly what to do

## Examples

### Example 1: Web Development Proposal

**Input**: Write a proposal for a $15,000 e-commerce website redesign for a boutique clothing store

**Output**:
```
PROPOSAL: E-COMMERCE WEBSITE REDESIGN

Prepared for: Bella's Boutique
Prepared by: [Your Agency]
Date: March 1, 2026
Valid until: March 15, 2026

---

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Bella's Boutique has built a loyal following over 10 years, but your current website is leaving money on the table. Mobile visitors (67% of your traffic) abandon carts at 3x the desktop rate, and your checkout process requires 7 clicks to complete a purchase.

We propose a complete e-commerce redesign focused on one goal: turning browsers into buyers. Our solution will reduce checkout friction, optimize for mobile, and integrate the email capture system you've been wanting.

With similar boutique clients, we've achieved 40-60% increases in conversion rates within 90 days of launch.

---

UNDERSTANDING YOUR NEEDS

Based on our discovery call, you're facing:
- Cart abandonment at 78% (industry average: 69%)
- Mobile users struggling with navigation
- No integration between website and email marketing
- Outdated product photography presentation
- Competitor sites outpacing you visually

The stakes: Every month with the current site costs an estimated $3,000-5,000 in lost sales.

---

PROPOSED SOLUTION

## Approach
Mobile-first redesign with conversion optimization built into every page. We'll streamline your checkout from 7 steps to 3, implement abandoned cart recovery, and create a visual experience that matches your in-store brand.

## Deliverables
- Custom Shopify theme (mobile-optimized)
- 3-step checkout implementation
- Email capture pop-ups (integrated with Klaviyo)
- Product page templates (up to 50 products migrated)
- Abandoned cart email sequence (3 emails)
- 30-day post-launch support

## Timeline
| Phase | Description | Duration |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Discovery & Design | Wireframes, mood boards, approval | 2 weeks |
| Development | Build and internal testing | 3 weeks |
| Content Migration | Products, copy, images | 1 week |
| Testing & Launch | QA, soft launch, go-live | 1 week |
| **Total** | **Project completion** | **7 weeks** |

### Example 2: Consulting Engagement Proposal

**Input**: Write a proposal for a $30,000 marketing strategy engagement for a B2B SaaS company

**Output**:
```
PROPOSAL: GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY ENGAGEMENT

Prepared for: CloudSync Solutions
Prepared by: [Your Consultancy]
Date: March 1, 2026
Valid until: March 21, 2026

---

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

CloudSync has a strong product but inconsistent pipeline. Your sales team closes at 35% when they get meetings, but lead flow is unpredictable. Marketing generates leads, but sales questions their quality.

We propose a 12-week strategy engagement to align your marketing and sales around a unified go-to-market playbook. The outcome: predictable pipeline, higher quality leads, and a repeatable system for scaling.

Our B2B SaaS clients typically see 40-70% increases in qualified pipeline within 6 months of implementation.

---

UNDERSTANDING YOUR NEEDS

From our assessment calls, the core challenges are:
- Marketing and sales operating on different definitions of "qualified"
- No documented ICP—team relies on intuition
- Content exists but isn't mapped to buyer journey
- Website converts at 0.8% (SaaS benchmark: 2-3%)
- Competitor X launched similar features; differentiation unclear

The cost of inaction: At your current growth rate, you'll miss your Series B metrics by 8+ months.

---

PROPOSED SOLUTION

## Approach
Deep-dive discovery, competitive analysis, and hands-on strategy development. We work alongside your team, not in a silo. You'll leave with a playbook your team can execute without us.

## Deliverables
- Ideal Customer Profile documentation (firmographic + psychographic)
- Competitive positioning matrix and messaging framework
- Lead scoring model (sales and marketing aligned)
- Content audit with gap analysis and 90-day content calendar
- Website conversion roadmap (prioritized improvements)
- Go-to-market playbook (50+ page strategy document)
- Team training sessions (2 x 90-minute workshops)

## Timeline
| Phase | Description | Duration |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Discovery | Stakeholder interviews, data analysis, audit | 3 weeks |
| Strategy Development | ICP, positioning, lead scoring | 4 weeks |
| Playbook Creation | Documentation, content strategy | 3 weeks |
| Training & Handoff | Team workshops, Q&A, implementation support | 2 weeks |
| **Total** | **Engagement completion** | **12 weeks** |
