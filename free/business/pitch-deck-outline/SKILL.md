## Storytelling Framework

### The Classic Arc
**Setup** (Slides 1-3): Establish the world, introduce the problem
**Confrontation** (Slides 4-7): Present solution, show evidence
**Resolution** (Slides 8-10): Make the ask, show the future

### The Problem-Solution Sandwich
1. Problem (pain)
2. Solution (relief)
3. Problem (objection)
4. Solution (answer)
5. Problem (risk of inaction)
6. Solution (path forward)

### The "Before/After" Structure
- Current state (painful)
- Future state (with your solution)
- How to get there

## Common Mistakes

- **Too much text**: Slides are visual aids, not documents
- **No clear ask**: What do you want them to DO?
- **Feature dumping**: Benefits > Features
- **Weak opening**: First 30 seconds determine engagement
- **Missing proof**: Claims without evidence
- **Competition slide lies**: "No real competitors" = red flag
- **Unrealistic projections**: Hockey stick without logic
