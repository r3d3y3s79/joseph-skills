## Cold Email Formulas

### The AIDA Formula
- **A**ttention: Hook with personalization
- **I**nterest: Relevance to their situation
- **D**esire: Value you can provide
- **A**ction: Clear next step

### The Problem-Agitate-Solve
- Problem: Identify their challenge
- Agitate: Show you understand the pain
- Solve: Brief mention of solution

### The Before-After-Bridge
- Before: Current state
- After: Desired state
- Bridge: How you help get there

### The Quick Question
- Ultra short (3-4 sentences)
- Single question CTA
- Gets replies through simplicity

## Personalization Tactics

### Research Signals
- Recent LinkedIn post or article they wrote
- Company news (funding, launch, hire)
- Podcast appearance or interview
- Mutual connection
- Specific work they've done

### What NOT to Personalize
- "I saw your company exists"
- Generic industry statements
- Obvious LinkedIn scrapes ("I see you're a CEO")

## Common Mistakes

- **Me-focused opener**: "I'm reaching out because WE..." (they don't care)
- **Too long**: Over 150 words = skimmed or deleted
- **Vague CTA**: "Let me know your thoughts" (think about what?)
- **Hard sell first email**: Asking for 30-minute call with stranger
- **No research evidence**: Could send to anyone = sent to no one
- **Multiple CTAs**: Confusion = no action

## Examples

### Example 1: Sales Outreach to SaaS Company

**Input**: Write a cold email selling marketing automation services to a Series A SaaS founder

**Output**:
```
SUBJECT LINE OPTIONS:
1. Question about [Company]'s content strategy
2. [Founder name], quick marketing thought
3. Saw your ProductHunt launch—idea for you

---

Hey [Name],

Congrats on the ProductHunt launch last week—#3 in dev tools is no joke. Noticed you're ramping up content (saw the blog posts from your new content hire).

Quick thought: We've helped 3 Series A dev tools companies (including [Similar Company]) turn content into pipeline—averaging 40% increase in demo requests within 90 days.

Would it be worth a 15-minute call to see if our approach fits what you're building?

Either way, rooting for the next launch.

Follow-up 2 (Day 7):
Subject: Different angle
"Realized I should've led with this: [Similar Company] went from 12 to 47 demo requests/month using our system. If that's interesting, happy to share exactly how. If not, no worries—I'll stop bugging you."

Follow-up 3 (Day 14):
Subject: Should I close the loop?
"Last note from me. If content-to-pipeline isn't a priority right now, totally get it. If timing changes, happy to reconnect. Good luck with the next milestone!"
```

Hey [Name],

Just finished your episode with [Recent Guest]—the part about building in public vs. stealth mode stuck with me. Shared it with my team.

I run [Company/Role], and we've done something your audience might find useful: [Specific achievement or unique angle, e.g., "grew from $0 to $2M ARR with zero paid ads using a system most founders haven't tried"].

A few topics I could cover:
- [Topic 1 that fits their show]
- [Topic 2 that fits their show]
- [Topic 3 that fits their show]

Would any of these fit an upcoming episode? Happy to send more details on whichever interests you.

Thanks for the show—looking forward to wherever it goes.

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to share how you approached [specific aspect of their experience]? I've done my research and have 3 specific questions—I won't waste your time.
