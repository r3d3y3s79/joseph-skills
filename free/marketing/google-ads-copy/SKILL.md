## Quick Reference

| Element | Character Limit | Best Practice |
|---------|-----------------|---------------|
| Headline | 30 characters | Keyword in first headline |
| Description | 90 characters | Benefit + CTA |
| Path | 15 chars x 2 | Keyword or offer |
| Sitelink title | 25 characters | Page-specific |
| Sitelink description | 35 chars x 2 | Value add |
| Callout | 25 characters | Unique selling points |

## RSA Strategy

### Headline Mix (Aim for 10-15)
- 2-3 with primary keyword
- 2-3 with secondary keywords
- 2-3 benefit-focused
- 2-3 CTA-focused
- 2-3 unique value props
- 1-2 with numbers/stats

### Description Mix (4 total)
- 1 primary benefit + CTA
- 1 features/specs
- 1 social proof/trust
- 1 offer/urgency

### Pinning Guidelines
- Pin brand name to Position 1 if needed
- Pin CTA to Position 2 or 3
- Don't over-pin (hurts machine learning)

## Google Ads Compliance

### Allowed
- Correct punctuation and grammar
- Relevant keywords
- Accurate claims
- Proper capitalization

### Not Allowed
- ALL CAPS (except acronyms)
- Excessive punctuation!!!
- Emojis in search ads
- Misleading claims
- Trademark violations
- Phone numbers in headlines

## Common Mistakes

- **Keyword stuffing**: Natural language beats awkward repetition
- **Same headlines repeating**: Variety helps machine learning
- **Ignoring paths**: Free real estate for keywords
- **No CTA in descriptions**: Tell them what to do
- **Over-pinning**: Let Google optimize
- **Ignoring extensions**: They boost click-through rate
