## Quick Reference

| Element | Best Practice |
|---------|--------------|
| Word count | 2-5 words for buttons |
| Action verbs | Start with verb (Get, Start, Join) |
| First person | "Get My Free Guide" beats "Get Your Free Guide" |
| Specificity | "Get 10 Templates" beats "Learn More" |
| Urgency | Time-limited when authentic |
| Value | State what they get, not what they do |

## CTA Frameworks

### Value-First CTA
Lead with what they get:
- "Get My Free Templates"
- "Unlock 30% Savings"
- "Claim Your Spot"

### Action-Outcome CTA
Combine action with result:
- "Start Saving Today"
- "Build My Website"
- "Double My Traffic"

### Urgency CTA
Time or scarcity trigger:
- "Get It Before Midnight"
- "Claim My Spot (12 Left)"
- "Start Free While Available"

### Risk-Removal CTA
Address hesitation directly:
- "Try Free for 30 Days"
- "Start Risk-Free"
- "Get It—Money Back Guaranteed"

## CTA Word Power Rankings

### Strong Action Verbs
Get, Start, Claim, Unlock, Discover, Join, Build, Create, Download, Access

### Weak/Banned Words
Submit, Click Here, Learn More (unless paired with specifics), Enter, Continue

### Power Modifiers
Free, Now, Today, Instant, My, Your, Exclusive, Limited

## Common Mistakes

- **"Submit"**: Feels like giving up something
- **"Click Here"**: Says nothing about value
- **Passive voice**: "Your download will begin" vs "Get Your Download"
- **Too long**: Button text over 5 words gets ignored
- **No context**: CTA without supporting headline/subtext
- **Same CTA everywhere**: Match CTA to funnel stage

## Examples

### Example 1: E-commerce Product Page

**Input**: Optimize the CTA "Add to Cart" for a premium skincare product page

**Output**:
```
CURRENT CTA ANALYSIS:
- Weakness identified: Generic, used by every store, no value proposition
- Opportunity: Emphasize the transformation or exclusive benefit

OPTIMIZED CTA OPTIONS:
1. "Get My Glow" - Outcome-focused, first person, emotional
2. "Start My Skincare Routine" - Beginning of journey framing
3. "Add to Bag + Free Samples" - Value-add incentive
4. "Yes, I Want Clearer Skin" - Affirmation + benefit statement
5. "Get It—Free Returns" - Risk removal upfront

RECOMMENDED WINNER: "Get My Glow" - Short, benefit-driven, personal. Works for premium positioning.

SUPPORTING ELEMENTS:
- Headline to pair: "See results in 14 days or your money back"
- Subtext/microcopy: "Free shipping on orders $50+ | Arrives in 2-3 days"
- Trust signals: "Join 50,000+ with clearer skin" + star rating

---

A/B TEST RECOMMENDATION:
- Control: "Add to Bag + Free Samples"
- Variant: "Get My Glow"
- Expected lift: 8-15% based on emotional vs transactional
```

### Example 2: SaaS Free Trial

**Input**: Optimize the CTA "Sign Up" for a project management tool's homepage

**Output**:
```
CURRENT CTA ANALYSIS:
- Weakness identified: "Sign Up" is commitment-focused, triggers resistance
- Opportunity: Emphasize free trial, instant value, no risk

OPTIMIZED CTA OPTIONS:
1. "Start Free Trial" - Clear, no commitment implied
2. "Start Organizing Today" - Outcome + immediacy
3. "Try Free for 14 Days" - Specific, time-bound, risk-free
4. "Get Started—No Card Needed" - Removes friction objection
5. "Build My First Project" - Instant value, action-oriented

RECOMMENDED WINNER: "Start Free—No Card Needed" - Combines free trial with major objection removal in one line.

SUPPORTING ELEMENTS:
- Headline to pair: "Stop losing projects in your inbox"
- Subtext/microcopy: "Set up in 2 minutes. Import from Trello, Asana, or start fresh."
- Trust signals: "Trusted by 10,000+ teams | 4.8/5 on G2"

---

A/B TEST RECOMMENDATION:
- Control: "Start Free—No Card Needed"
- Variant: "Build My First Project Free"
- Expected lift: 12-20% with no-card messaging
```

### Example 3: Newsletter Signup

**Input**: Optimize the CTA "Subscribe" for a marketing tips newsletter

**Output**:
```
CURRENT CTA ANALYSIS:
- Weakness identified: "Subscribe" implies obligation, ongoing commitment
- Opportunity: Focus on immediate value they'll receive

OPTIMIZED CTA OPTIONS:
1. "Get Weekly Tips" - What they receive, clear frequency
2. "Join 5,000+ Marketers" - Social proof built into CTA
3. "Send Me the Tips" - First person, conversational
4. "Get My First Tip Now" - Instant gratification
5. "Yes, I Want Better Campaigns" - Affirmation + outcome

RECOMMENDED WINNER: "Send Me the Tips" - Conversational, low commitment feeling, first person.

SUPPORTING ELEMENTS:
- Headline to pair: "One marketing tip. Every Tuesday. That's it."
- Subtext/microcopy: "No spam. Unsubscribe anytime. (We won't be offended.)"
- Trust signals: "Join 5,247 marketers who read us weekly"

---

A/B TEST RECOMMENDATION:
- Control: "Send Me the Tips"
- Variant: "Join 5,000+ Marketers"
- Expected lift: 15-25% vs generic "Subscribe"
```
