- Writing Stories or Reels ad text

---

## Quick Reference

| Platform | Primary Text Limit | Best Practice |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|
| Facebook | 125 chars visible | Front-load value |
| Instagram | 125 chars visible | Visual-first, minimal text |
| LinkedIn | 150 chars visible | Professional, specific results |
| TikTok | Native, not ad-like | Blend in, don't interrupt |
| X (Twitter) | 280 chars total | Punchy, conversational |

## Platform-Specific Guidelines

### Facebook/Instagram Feed
- First 125 characters are crucial (rest is truncated)
- Use line breaks for readability
- Emojis: 1-2 max, purposeful
- Don't repeat headline in primary text

### Instagram Stories/Reels
- Minimal text overlay (under 20% of image)
- Vertical-first design
- Sound-on optimization for Reels
- Quick hook in first 2 seconds

### LinkedIn
- Professional but not boring
- Results and data perform well
- Thought leadership angle works
- Avoid hard sell—provide value

### TikTok
- Native content, not polished ads
- Speak like a creator, not a brand
- Hook in first second
- Trends and sounds when relevant

### X (Twitter)
- Concise and punchy
- Thread format for longer messages
- Link at end, not middle
- Conversational tone wins

## Common Mistakes

- **Ignoring platform culture**: LinkedIn ad language on TikTok fails
- **Too much text**: Social is visual-first
- **Generic creative**: Stock photos underperform
- **Missing the hook**: First 3 seconds decide everything
- **Asking too much**: One CTA per ad
- **Forgetting mobile**: 90%+ view on phones

## Examples

```

AUDIENCE NOTES:
- Best for: VP Sales, Sales Directors, Sales Ops Managers
- Targeting suggestions: Company size 50-500, Sales titles, CRM tool users (Salesforce, HubSpot)

---

VARIANTS:
1. Pain-focused: "Your reps are drowning in admin. Here's the fix."
2. Proof-focused: "34% higher close rates. See how Acme Corp did it with SalesFlow."
