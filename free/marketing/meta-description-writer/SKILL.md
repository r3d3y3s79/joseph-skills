## Search Intent Matching

### Informational
- Start with "Learn," "Discover," "Find out"
- Promise answers and insights
- Example: "Learn how to..."

### Commercial
- Comparison language, "best," "top," "vs"
- Help with decisions
- Example: "Compare the top..."

### Transactional
- Action verbs: "Buy," "Get," "Order," "Download"
- Prices, offers, availability
- Example: "Shop now and get..."

### Navigational
- Brand clarity, what they'll find
- Simple, direct
- Example: "Official [brand] site..."

## Common Mistakes

- **Too short**: Under 120 characters wastes SERP real estate
- **Too long**: Gets truncated awkwardly mid-sentence
- **Keyword stuffing**: Reads unnaturally, hurts CTR
- **Duplicate descriptions**: Each page needs unique copy
- **No CTA**: Give them a reason to click
- **Missing value prop**: Why click this result over others?
- **Passive voice**: Active voice drives action
