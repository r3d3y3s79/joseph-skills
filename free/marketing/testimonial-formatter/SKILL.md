## Common Mistakes

- **Over-editing**: Loses authentic voice
- **No attribution**: Anonymous = not credible
- **Too long**: Nobody reads walls of text
- **No context**: Missing role, company, timeframe
- **Generic praise**: "Great product!" means nothing
- **Cherry-picking**: Removing important caveats
- **Wrong placement**: Using long testimonials in quick-scan sections

## Examples

### Example 1: B2B Software Testimonial

**Input**: "Honestly when we first started using TaskFlow I wasn't sure about it because we'd tried other project management tools before and they always end up abandoned. But this one is different, the team actually uses it. We've been using it for about 8 months now and I can honestly say it's saved us probably 15-20 hours a week that we used to spend in status meetings and Slack threads trying to figure out what everyone was working on. The dashboard view is what sold the team on it. Worth every penny of the subscription."

### Example 2: E-commerce Product Testimonial

**Input**: "OK so I have really bad back problems from sitting all day coding and I've tried like 4 different chairs including the expensive Herman Miller one. This chair (ErgoMax) is honestly the best I've found and it's like half the price. I've had it for 3 months and my back pain is basically gone by end of day. I used to need to take breaks every hour but now I can work straight through. The lumbar support is the key honestly. My only complaint is the armrests took a while to adjust right but once I got them dialed in it's perfect. 10/10 recommend for anyone with back issues who works from home."

### Example 3: Service Business Testimonial

**Input**: "I put off doing my taxes for like 3 years because I'm a freelancer and my finances are kind of a mess and I was scared what an accountant would say. SimplBooks made it not scary. They were super patient, didn't judge me, and actually got me a bigger refund than I expected because they found deductions I didn't know about. I'm now a monthly subscriber and it just feels good to not have that stress hanging over me anymore. If you're a freelancer who's been putting this off, just do it."
