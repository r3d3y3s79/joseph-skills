## Quick Reference

| Element | Specification |
|---------|--------------|
| Headline | 10 words or less, no clever wordplay |
| Lead paragraph | Who, what, when, where, why in 25-30 words |
| Total length | 400-500 words ideal |
| Quotes | 1-2, attributed with full name and title |
| Boilerplate | 75-100 words about company |
| Format | AP style, third person |

## Press Release Structure

### 1. Contact Block
- Company name
- Media contact name
- Email and phone
- "FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE" or embargo date

### 2. Headline
- Factual, not clever
- Lead with company name if established brand
- Include the action (launches, announces, raises)

### 3. Subheadline
- Adds context headline couldn't fit
- Can include key metric or differentiation

### 4. Lead Paragraph
- The entire story in one paragraph
- Would someone understand the news from just this?
- Include key metric or claim

### 5. Body Paragraphs
- Context and background
- Quotes from executives
- Supporting data
- Availability and next steps

### 6. Boilerplate
- Standard "About [Company]" paragraph
- Include founding year, HQ location
- Brief value proposition
- Website URL

## Quote Guidelines

### Do's
- Sound like a human said it
- Add color the facts can't convey
- Include forward-looking statements
- Use full name and title

### Don'ts
- "We're excited to announce..."
- Generic corporate speak
- Multiple quotes saying the same thing
- Quotes that just restate facts

### Quote Templates
- **Vision**: "[Name] said, 'This [launch/milestone] represents our commitment to [bigger mission].'"
- **Customer impact**: "'Our customers asked for [X], and [product] delivers [specific benefit],' said [Name]."
- **Traction**: "'Reaching [milestone] in [timeframe] validates [strategy],' said [Name]."

## Common Mistakes

- **Burying the lead**: News should be in sentence one
- **Excessive superlatives**: "Revolutionary," "groundbreaking" = instant delete
- **Missing the "so what"**: Why should readers care?
- **Too long**: Over 500 words loses attention
- **Bad quotes**: "We're thrilled" is not news
- **No contact info**: Journalists can't follow up
- **Wrong format**: Must be third person, AP style

## Examples

### Example 1: Product Launch Press Release

**Input**: Write a press release for a SaaS company launching an AI feature that automates email responses

**Output**:
```
RELEASE TYPE: Product launch
NEWSWORTHINESS ANGLE: First AI email assistant trained on company's own communication style

FLOWMAIL LAUNCHES AI RESPONSE ASSISTANT FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE TEAMS

New feature uses company's historical emails to draft on-brand responses, reducing reply time by 60%

SAN FRANCISCO, CA — March 1, 2026 — FlowMail, a customer communication platform for mid-market companies, today announced the launch of AI Response Assistant, a feature that drafts email replies based on a company's unique communication style. Early adopters report a 60% reduction in average response time.

Unlike generic AI writing tools, FlowMail's AI Response Assistant trains on each company's historical email data—learning tone, terminology, and common responses. Customer service representatives can generate draft replies with one click, then review and send in seconds rather than minutes.

"Support teams are overwhelmed, but customers still expect fast, personalized responses," said David Park, CEO of FlowMail. "AI Response Assistant gives teams the speed of automation with the authenticity of human communication. The AI sounds like your team because it learned from your team."

The feature integrates with FlowMail's existing shared inbox and includes confidence scoring, human review workflows, and response analytics. Companies can set guardrails for sensitive topics that require manual handling.

"We've been beta testing for three months and cut our first-response time from 4 hours to under 90 minutes," said Rachel Torres, Head of Support at Canopy Software, a FlowMail customer. "More importantly, our customer satisfaction scores stayed the same—customers can't tell the difference."

AI Response Assistant is available today for all FlowMail Professional and Enterprise customers at no additional cost. Teams can begin training their AI model immediately using historical email data.

CARBONTRACK RAISES $25 MILLION SERIES A TO SCALE CARBON ACCOUNTING FOR MANUFACTURERS

Round led by Climate Capital with participation from Breakthrough Energy Ventures

AUSTIN, TX — March 1, 2026 — CarbonTrack, a carbon accounting platform for manufacturing companies, today announced a $25 million Series A round led by Climate Capital, with participation from Breakthrough Energy Ventures and existing investors Sequoia Scout and Y Combinator. The funding will accelerate product development and expand the company's go-to-market team.

CarbonTrack provides real-time carbon tracking across manufacturing supply chains, helping companies measure, report, and reduce emissions. The platform integrates with existing ERP and production systems to calculate emissions at the product and process level—data that manufacturers increasingly need to meet regulatory requirements and customer sustainability demands.

"Manufacturers want to reduce emissions but can't manage what they can't measure," said Priya Sharma, CEO and co-founder of CarbonTrack. "Our platform gives operations teams the same visibility into carbon that they have into cost and quality. This funding lets us expand beyond our current automotive and electronics customers into industrial manufacturing."

The company has grown revenue 4x year-over-year and now serves over 100 manufacturing facilities across North America and Europe. CarbonTrack customers have collectively identified 200,000 tons of potential annual emissions reductions.

"CarbonTrack is building the accounting layer for manufacturing decarbonization," said James Wilson, Partner at Climate Capital. "Their product-level granularity is exactly what manufacturers need as carbon becomes a line item in procurement decisions."

The Series A brings CarbonTrack's total funding to $32 million. The company plans to double its team from 45 to 90 employees over the next 12 months, with a focus on engineering and customer success.
