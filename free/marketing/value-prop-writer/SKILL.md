## Value Proposition Components

### Relevance
- Who is this for?
- What problem does it solve?
- Does the audience recognize themselves?

### Quantified Value
- How much time/money saved?
- What specific results?
- Measurable improvements?

### Differentiation
- Why you vs. alternatives?
- What's unique about your approach?
- What do competitors lack?

## Common Mistakes

- **Too vague**: "We help you succeed" means nothing
- **Feature focus**: List benefits, not features
- **No differentiation**: Could apply to any competitor
- **Jargon overload**: Confuses instead of clarifies
- **Multiple messages**: One clear value, not five
- **Ignoring audience**: Speaking to everyone = speaking to no one
