## Ad Copy Frameworks

### PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solution)
- Problem: Identify the pain point
- Agitate: Make it feel urgent
- Solution: Present your offer

### AIDA (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action)
- Attention: Bold headline
- Interest: Engage with relevance
- Desire: Create want
- Action: Clear CTA

### BAB (Before-After-Bridge)
- Before: Current painful state
- After: Desired outcome
- Bridge: Your product/service

### 4Ps (Picture-Promise-Prove-Push)
- Picture: Paint the scenario
- Promise: State the benefit
- Prove: Provide evidence
- Push: Call to action

## Common Mistakes

- **Feature dumping**: List benefits, not specs
- **Weak headlines**: Front-load the hook
- **Multiple CTAs**: One action only
- **No urgency**: Give reason to act now
- **Generic claims**: Be specific with numbers
- **Ignoring platform norms**: Adapt to each channel
